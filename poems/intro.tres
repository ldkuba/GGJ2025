text = "The Whispers of the Saints Bathhouse

Through old hallways and shadows so deep,
A bathhouse stands where the silence weeps.
My brother's steps were last ever heard, 
Now lost like a whistle in the wind, everything is blurred.

The tiled halls where the water sings,
Do I already see scary things?
Each echo calls, each shadow bends,
As if to warn how my story ends."
